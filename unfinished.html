        <h1>The path to a better project</h1>
        <p>Due to the lack of time and the non-ending issues with things that SHOULD have been easier (as explained in "struggles and overcoming them")<br>
        I decided and came to the conclusion that i wouldn't be able to complete my project at its full potential, therefore, i think<br>
    of this as a Demo, and im going to explain what i plan to do about this project in the nearby future</p>
    <p>
        As you may have noticed, the title of the project is 'BioSync - when Biometrics meets robotics', thus, it doesn't involve<br>
        Biometrics at all! Biometrics is the use of physical characteristics for recognition, all my project currently does<br>
        is assign coordinates to your fingers using an algorithm and work based off them, must not implement a recognition and lock system.
    </p>
    <h3><b> How will the biometrics work for this project in the future?</b></h3>
    <p>
        I plan to implement a finger-print scan system, the code will have a condition (if,else,elif) <br>
        with a hardcoded key, that key will be the exact key my fingerprint gives, if someone else tries
        to scan their fingerprint the program will not run, as it doesn't match the program's hardcoded key,
        for each fingerprint gives different one.
    </p>
    <p>
        I plan to keep improving the model throughout time goes by, as this is merely a prototype. Here are some of my ideas:
        <ul>
            <li>Go from a car to a Drone moving based off your hand movement, capable of lifting, avoiding obstacles, etc</li>
            <li>Add Facial recognition along with finger-print scan with the Biometrics</li>
            <li>Fix improvised/worked-around wiring and building (This could colapse easily)</li>
            <li>Wireless communication: The ESP32 Module failed, for i tried a thousand and beyond methods<br>
            to make the module transfer data to Arduino, but in the end i couldn't achieve it, in the future<br>
        i plan getting my hands on an Arduino board specifically designed for Wireless communication</li>
        </ul>
