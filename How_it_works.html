            <h1>MediaPipe</h1>
            <p> MediaPipe is an open-source framework developed by Google for building machine learning pipelines, <br>
                particularly for processing time-series data such as video, audio, and text. It is designed to work across <br>
                multiple platforms, including desktops, mobile devices (Android and iOS), and embedded systems<br>
                 like Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano, and in this case, Arduino.</p>

            <h1> OpenCV</h1>
            <p> OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning<br>
                 software library. It is widely used for various image and video processing tasks, such as object detection, <br>
                 face recognition, and image transformation. OpenCV supports multiple programming languages, including Python,<br>
                  C++, and Java. </p>

                <h1> How Were These Libraries Used Then?</h1>
                <p> MediaPipe and CV both work together as a team in my code, openCV will open the camera, take frames<br>
                from it, and translate them into information - but what information? That's where MediaPipe comes in,<br>
            MediaPipe tracks 21 landmarks all throughout your fingers, it's just what you do with them that makes everything work</p>
            <h1> The Code, what makes Serial Comunication Awesome</h1>
            <h4> <b><u>What is Serial Communication(In Arduino)?</u></b></h4>
            <p> Serial communication in Arduino facilitates data exchange between the Arduino board<br>
                 and external devices such as computers, sensors, or other microcontrollers.<br>
                  It is a fundamental feature of Arduino, enabling debugging, data logging, and interaction with peripherals,
                  In this case, Python communicates with the Arduino through a wireless bluetooth module (Esp32).
                Python sends the information, the Arduino IDE recieves it and processes it, and finally
            the Arduino executes it</p>
            <br>
            <h1>A brief Summary of what's Hardcoded:</h1>
            <p>Here we Import the necessary libraries in order for us to be able to use those functionns:</p>
            <img src = "Images_Host_server/Screenshot 2025-11-04 084409.png" alt = "Sorry not loading!" width = 500>
            <div style = "margin-bottom: 20px">     
                <p> Here we set Python to send information through serial on Port 4 at 9600 bits, the ideal number for this:</p>
                <img src = "Images_Host_server/Screenshot 2025-11-04 084458.png" alt = "Sorry not loading!" width = "500">
                </div>
                <div style = "margin-bottom:20px">
                    <p>Here we do several things, we first use 'Hands()' and store it on a variable, this tell mediapipe (mp)<br>
                    that we are tracking hands using the hand module, which assigns 21 landmarks throughout our hand, then <br>
                we use 'video.capture' from OpenCV to turn on the webcam, as a last thing we create variables and use
            the 'max' function along with 'len' in order to take the maximum value and take its lenght.</p>
                    <img src = "Images_Host_server/Screenshot 2025-11-04 084712.png" alt = "Sorry not loading!" width = "500">
                </div>
                <div style = "margin-bottom:20px">
                    <p>Here we create 2 functions at first, this isn't necessary but its best for modular code,<br>
                        I created parameters to store values (in this case, the parameters act as containers for the calculated values)<br>
                        Inside each function, an already built-in function (such as .landmark) complete a certain role,<br>
                        then i just calculate the distance from point to point to work based off that
                    </p>
                    <img src = "Images_Host_server/Screenshot 2025-11-04 084755.png" alt = "Sorry not loading!" width = "500">
                    </div>
                    <div style = "margin-bottom:20px">
                        <p>
                            Here we just capture a frame, a specific frame from the web-cam and turn it into RGB (Red,Green, Blue) which<br>
                            is the format Mediapipe supports, basically translating pixels to color, this helps MediaPipe identify
                            where the landmakrs have moved by contrasting them against your skin (Computer Vision Principles)<br>
                            this with the help of 'process' . Then we store the values in 3 different variables in order to set their
                            default value (for servo its 90 degrees, for motors its 0 RPM, or in this case, PWM (pulse width modulation))

                            Our very last piece of code, yet the <b> MOST</b> important! without it, none of this would work <br>
                            what it does is to 'write' (literally) using the .write function, what it does is that it sends
                            the line of code to Arduino through serial, allowing it to interpret it as part of its own, and   
                            therefore act upon it (execute it) <br>
                            As a last thing, it just detects/waits for you to press the 'q' key for the program to stop running,
                            'destroyAllWindows' and all that closes the webcam path, closes Serial communication, etc
