        we think of ideas and picture them as something that should be achieved quick, but when actually trying
        to execute them...

            The Original Idea:
        </h1>
        <p>
            My original idea had nothing to do with what im currently doing, i was planning on<br>
            making a fully-automated AI enviorment that would control a drone, but since it was hard<br>
            to find a programmable drone, or even if there was, that it didn't use blocky code for it.
            I ended up dropping the idea after failing to succesfully make the vision AI send the <br>
            information to the index AI through text-to-speech, and other issues i won't dive into.
        </p>
        <h1>
            DcMotor Desperation:
        </h1>
        <p> 
            One of the main reasons i dropped the main idea was due to wrongly provided DcMotors that didn't react to <br>
            the submitted Arduino IDE code, this, i think, because the smartcarShield v1.1 couldn't provide instructions<br>
            or direction to the motors at all, you need a module for this, then why didn't it come with the original kit?
        </p>
        <h1>
             The Rebirth
        </h1>
        <p>
            After the first project failed, i got frustrated, deeply, i was tired, i overslept, i tried so hard, all for nothing, until...<br>
            i stumbled across a 40 second video, my YT feed is filled with tech-related stuff, so it wasn't surprising when i saw<br>
            someone controlling a servo, but that's the thing, he wasn't using sketch, he was using his own hands and a camera.
            I looked up what library or method that was, and the rest is history.
            </p>

            Learning Stage
        </h1>
        <p>
            Of course i wasn't born knowing how to use MediaPipe and OpenCV, so i used serveral tools and sources to help me,
            these include:
            <ol>
                <li>Gemini 'Step-by-step learning' option</li>

                <li>>Several Youtube Videos when i needed visual assitance, this is the one that helped me the most to understand<br> the basic layout and methods,
                        even though it wasn't related to my project, it did show the basics of the libraries:<br>

                        </li>
                        <li> I also looked for some already-existing code in Github in order to have an idea of how to take it, and adjust it so it could send<br> data to
                        my Arduino</li>
                        <li> Just as a note, i already had some Arduino experience (IDE) So programming the servos<br>
                        and DcMotors wasn't difficult, but managing to recieve data from Python was indeed tedious</li>

                                The ESP32 module, supposedly having 'wifi + bluetooth' hardware was, and is a nightmare, probably by the time<br>
                                im done documenting this i still haven't made the robot wireless, if so, then i presented/im going to present
                                a robot using a serial cable, but i'll also add it to the 'why this is a demo' section.
