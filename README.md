# Overview
BioSync is a project that involves a biological input(a.k.a your hand) and outputs robotic movements (a.k.a the robot)

# How It Works
Using MediaPipe and OpenCV along with Hardcoded adjustments and formulas (More on website)

# How to Run:
Inside the website there is all the code broken into parts (exception of the Arduino one),
if you want the codes for such, i have another repo for that specific reason

# Tech Stack
Python, C++ (Arduino IDE), OpenCV, MediaPipe, HTML and CSS (website)

# Website
This Repo just contains the documentatuion, if you want to see the video with it working please visit my Youtube Channel (link in website)
And if you want the code check my other repository, "BioSync Code"

# Prototyope
This is a prototype, so it is not finished yet
